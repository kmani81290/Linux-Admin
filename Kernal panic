Kernel Panics
Since the kernel handles the most basic functions of a computer, if it crashes it can take down the entire computer. 
This undesirable event is called a "kernel panic" on macOS and Unix systems. It is similar to the blue screen of death in Windows. 
The only way to recover from a kernel panic is to restart your computer.

NOTE: Kernel panics are often caused by hardware communication issues. Therefore, if your computer is producing repeated kernel panics,
try unplugging unnecessary devices to see if that fixes the problem.
